# Machine-Learning-Medical-Cost-Prediction-Health-domain-
In this project, by using a set of ML algorithms, a computational intelligence approach is applied to predict healthcare insurance costs.
The medical insurance dataset was utilised for training and testing the Linear Regression, KNN Regressor, Support Vector Regression, Gradient Boosting Regressor, Decision Tree and Random Forest Regressor, ML algorithms.
The resultant outcome revealed that Gradient Boosting Regressor achieved least error.
